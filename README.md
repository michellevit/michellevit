# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Michelle, and I'm a developer currently working at GTC. I first encountered computer science at UBC, and though my path led me into administration and accounting, I found myself gravitating back to towards coding as I discovered the value in automating simple tasks and modernizing workflows.
